Manual Testing vs Automated Testing
- Manual testing is when a developer manually tests a piece of code to make sure it returns what's expected
- Automated testing can be used to test the same piece of code, but automatically using test cases

Unit Testing vs Integration Testing
- Unit testing is testing individual peices of code at a more granular level, rather than the application as a whole
- Ex: A single function
- Integration testing, on the other hand, is testing how two units of a piece of software interface with each other.

Unit Tests
- Uses assertions that are boolean (true or false)
- If the expected result is what's returned, then pass
- If not, fail
- unittest, pytest modules
